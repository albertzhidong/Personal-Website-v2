				<div class="subhead">
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">March 01, 2019</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">1317 EST</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">3m 33s</p>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">‚úãüèºüëãüèº ‚úãüèº,</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I‚Äôve been feeling the dreaded imposter syndrome heavy recently.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I‚Äôm not sure why, but in these last few weeks, it‚Äôs been flaring up at the most inopportune times. A few days ago, I was on a phone with a friend talking through design with them and while they were speaking, I thought to myself:</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy italic">"Damn, do I really know enough to give them advice here?"</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">There‚Äôs a part of me that knows I do (I promise!) but sometimes that part of me hides under the covers refusing to show its face. I have to rip off its Gravity Blanket and kick its ass out of bed. I usually knock over its Otherland candles in the process. Even mini-me is an unnecessarily boujee tech bro.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">In the middle of one of these episodes of self-doubt, I started thinking about the ways I‚Äôve been learning and consuming information.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">A good chunk of my learnings each day comes from mediums that are list-centric, the nature of aggregators like Twitter and many email newsletters. Each one of these mediums provides multiple news nuggets, and every one of them is screaming for attention and begging to be clicked on.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The fool I am, I click on them all.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">In this deluge of facts and opinions, my thoughts get swept away. Numbers and characters swirl around my head while my brain desperately tries to grab everything and keep it in the box that is my memory. It often fails and most of this information rushes out of my head, refusing to be contained.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">By the end of the day, I generally consume thousands of individual bits of content. And as a result of that scale, none are processed deeply. For the next couple of days, I would be able to quote random figures about funding valuations or design trends. I would be able to throw out new industry buzzwords or the word for word opinions of ~experts~ with ease.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">For personal conclusions or analyses though, there‚Äôs nothing. Guess that means I‚Äôve really learned nothing as well then.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Even worse, consuming all of that content is absolutely EXHAUSTING. My entire Wednesday was full of reading short-form (defining this as &#60;1 min) blurbs and tweets and by the end of the day, my emotions were utterly drained. The amount of context-switching between ideas sucked out all of my energy and I jumped (read: crawled wine-drunk) onto my bed a husk of the man that I was when I work up that morning.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Why do I do this to myself? Anxiety mostly. </p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Anxiety from not knowing the latest tech and design trends. Fear of seeming ignorant on phone call and at dinners. Stress from talking to founders that I admire and not knowing the latest news around the industry. I feel the need to consume copious amounts of content so that when the time is right, I can regurgitate these facts and spit them out to make myself seem well-read and worthy of giving advice.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">It‚Äôs a twisted form of social performativity exacerbated by imposter syndrome and FOMO.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">So something I‚Äôve been thinking about instead is that: what if we‚Äôre given just one high-quality idea (Note: high-quality is relative here, define it as you wish) and we spend our day‚Äôs spare energy analyzing and unpacking it.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Yes one idea is significantly less than a thousand, but the worth of our understanding of that single idea may be so much more.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The situation of Amazon backing out of NYC or on the nature of pine trees are both multifaceted topics that deserve more than just a brief article or a passing thought. Ancient monks, ascetics, and scholars of various affiliations have been known to spend years on a single idea of that level of complexity. We should be able to do that for a day.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">One day for focusing on just one idea. Forgiving ourselves the time to let our minds wander around and between its structure. For formulating our own opinions and re-examining them over and over. For discovering parallels between its essence and our present. For engaging deeply with it and with all of our soul.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I think that‚Äôs beautiful, but I‚Äôm also a foolish romantic.</p>

				<h2 class="Georgia normalWeight">Last Rites - 01</h2>
				<div class="subhead">
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">February 23, 2019</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">0125 EST</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">3m 35s</p>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Evening fam.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">A little bit of personal news to start off: I left Pison two weeks ago. It was an end I've been planning for a few weeks now but a sad one nonetheless. Once the new semester rolled around and I started re-evaluating what I wanted to spend my time on, I realized that I just didn't have any more room in my schedule for Pison. The problems that they was tackling was truly at the frontier of human-computer interaction and led to some really interesting projects in my time at the company. I learned a lot about speculative design from them and am very grateful towards the entire team for the experience they gave me. If anyone wants to work at an innovative early-stage company creating the next big interaction paradigm, hmu for the intro!</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">So onwards to the main topic, in these last few months, I‚Äôve been attempting to become more aware of my personal decision-making framework and have recently reached a point where I feel comfortable consciously inserting my own axes into that framework. These axes have been quite varied, most are just fun little ideas I've been wanting to play around with as a experiment, but one I‚Äôve been using recently has proved to be both a valid and useful metric to judge life decisions against ‚Äî its the envisioning of my own last rites.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Historically in Christianity, the ritual of last rites was meant to prep the soul of the dying person for their inevitable departure from the earth. It‚Äôs the occasion for them to confess their sins, seek forgiveness, and attain spiritual peace through the guidance of a holy man, often a priest. The loose ends of their life, that which plagues the last moments of existence, are soothed by this priest so that they may travel to the flip side free of earthly worries and regrets.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I really vibed with the concept and wanted to understand how it might manifest in my own personal life, as an agnostic theist.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">As a result, I decided to try to insert that idea into my decision-making framework and envision the future form of myself in the minutes leading up to my death. Those are the moments when a devout christian would generally be given their last rites and I wanted to use my self-constructed ideal of those moments as a point to consider when assessing the opportunity sets that arise in day-to-day life.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">In those future moments:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bodyCopy">What thoughts do I want to run through my head?</li>
					<li class="bodyCopy">What are the circumstances leading up to my death?</li>
					<li class="bodyCopy">How would I want my friends and family to feel? </li>
					<li class="bodyCopy">What are the last things in the world that I would want to sense?</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Initially, this idea didn‚Äôt appear to me as anything more than the classic questions of ‚ÄúWhere will you be in 5 years?‚Äù or ‚Äú How do you want people to remember you by?‚Äù ‚Äî basic interview questions. The nuance here though is the idea of finality. There‚Äôs no going forward ‚Äî its the final moments of my life and my feelings, reflections, and thoughts in those moments are the last ones that I will ever make.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">This nuance is what allows for the exercise to output significantly deviant ideas from the ones that are normally engaged with, turning it into a methodology for surfacing values that one holds dear and putting them into a concrete context.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The ideal then becomes the manifestation of a set of abstract principles in a discrete set in the time, allowing for the succinct comprehension and tangible application of those values into a day-to-day decision-making framework.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">It makes that decision-making process a bit more fun as a bonus.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I really wanted to write a bit about how I envisioned my own ideal last rites but this post has started to get a bit long. I‚Äôve found that around 500 words is about how much I can write comfortably without feeling the urge to proofread excessively and would like to stay at that level for the sake of brevity in creation and consumption ‚Äî hopefully this keeps the content fresh and engaging for y'all as well.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Until next time.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Rest well ‚úåüèΩ</p>

				<h2 class="Georgia normalWeight">Fog and Murmurs</h2>
				<div class="subhead">
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">February 14, 2019</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">2306 EST</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">1m 39s</p>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I‚Äôve been dreaming a lot recently.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">One dream has been appearing over and over again ‚Äî one of fog and murmurs. Lost in a world of infinity with all sights and sounds alike, the axes collude and intertwine.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">When the daybreaks‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, my senses become overwhelmed with the auras of the world ‚Äî an 180¬∞ deviation from my dream state. It‚Äôs a fearful experience. I just want to close my eyes again.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Lately, I‚Äôve been trying to be less aware of the world. The idea of conscious ignorance has been at the back of mind for much of the past few weeks. There is so much in the world, and the vast majority of it are extraordinarily weak signals. I‚Äôm hoping to block those out and allow only the strong ones through. Those are the ones that invigorate and depress, renew and destroy. In a normal distribution, it‚Äôs the tails of the 95.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Through simple existence, our senses have developed filtering mechanisms to parse out the noise of the world. With an infinite number of stimuli and a limited amount of cognitive ability, our bodies have built for us a natural defense mechanism for making sure we aren‚Äôt constantly bombarded with information.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">It works well.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I think we can do better though ‚Äî creating an internal world of fog and murmurs, where only the strongest lights and sounds reach us, each one with the ability to shake our world away from the steady state and impart upon us, the utmost extremities of emotions.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The goal is the ocean. Infinity of mice and men, a world of fog and murmurs only broken by the greatest of stimuli. Inconsequential to the world ‚Äî the rustling of the wind-blown bush ‚Äî but of consequence to us. It need not matter what breaks us from free from our idyllic harmony, only that it impacts and that we meditate upon it. For only the strongest of substances should be the ones that reach out hearts and remind us ‚Äî hey, we‚Äôre still alive.</p>

				<h2 class="Georgia normalWeight">On the Future of Gesture</h2>
				<div class="subhead">
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">January 17, 2019</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">1856 EST</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">2m 09s</p>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Working in AR has led me to spend an unhealthy amount of time recently thinking about the new interaction paradigms that may arise alongside this new technology. One of the most compelling ones for me is gesture-based interactions.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Looking at the current major interaction paradigms, we can abstract two major commonalities from them that are crucial for their continued existence: 1) they are agnostic across most population demographics ‚Äî age, language, and major factors native to the human condition and 2) they require relatively similar levels of effort in the general case and a distinctly lower level of effort in their specific niche cases.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The traditional notions of gesture-based interactions, as exampled by Microsoft Kinect and the cult-classic: Minority Report, are antithetical to both of these commonalities.</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="bodyCopy">Present gestural language is segmented across demographics. Like memes, gestures are created by the collective consciousness of a group and are only used + understood within the group. Those outside the group lack the context and mental models to interpret gestures of other groups. Demographical divides create the most obvious groups - splintering populations across age, race, and culture.</li>
					<li class="bodyCopy">Present gestural language also contains multiple instances of complex movements that are exhausting at scale. i.e. pointing with the finger to select objects or placing a finger to the lips. Generally, all full-arm movements require a level of effort an order of magnitude above wrist-only movements (writing) and finger-only movements (tapping).</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="bodyCopy">My personal belief here is that for a gesture-based interaction paradigm to evolve beyond being just a gimmick, the interaction has to be comprised of a set of primitives in which people can put together (with context) to form the command they want AND it has to be a non-trivial improvement above existing paradigms in non-niche scenarios.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">A few months ago, I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to further develop this thesis by joining the team at <a href="https://pisontechnology.com/" class="hyperlink hyperlinkStart nowrap textblack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pison Technologies</a> as their first interaction designer focused on gestures. Our research surrounds decoding our body's nerve and muscle signals ‚Äî coupling these signals with an IMU, we can understand a broad range of finger, wrist, and arm movements that were made by a user.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Unlike traditional notions of gestural interfaces that are translated by cameras using computer vision, Pison gestures are translated by a small wearable wristband, allowing for commands to be sent discreetly and effortlessly from spatially-agnostic locations ‚Äî commands as simple as a flick of a finger.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I‚Äôm excited to see what we create.</p>
