				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I’ve been dreaming a lot recently.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">One dream has been appearing over and over again — one of fog and murmurs. Lost in a world of infinity with all sights and sounds alike, the axes collude and intertwine.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">When the daybreaks™️, my senses become overwhelmed with the auras of the world — an 180° deviation dfrom my dream state. It’s a fearful experience. I just want to close my eyes again.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Lately, I’ve been trying to be less aware of the world. The idea of conscious ignorance has been at the back of mind for much of the past few weeks. There is so much in the world, and the vast majority of it are extraordinarily weak signals. I’m hoping to block those out and allow only the strong ones through. Those are the ones that invigorate and depress, renew and destroy. In a normal distribution, it’s the tails of the 95.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Through simple existence, our senses have developed filtering mechanisms to parse out the noise of the world. With an infinite number of stimuli and a limited amount of cognitive ability, our bodies have built for us a natural defense mechanism for making sure we aren’t constantly bombarded with information.  </p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">It works well.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I think we can do better though — creating an internal world of fog and murmurs, where only the strongest lights and sounds reach us, each one with the ability to shake our world away from the steady state and impart upon us, the utmost extremities of emotions.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The goal is the ocean. Infinity of mice and men, a world of fog and murmurs only broken by the greatest of stimuli. Inconsequential to the world — the rustling of the wind-blown bush — but of consequence to us. It need not matter what breaks us from free from our idyllic harmony, only that it impacts and that we meditate upon it. For only the strongest of substances should be the ones that reach out hearts and remind us — hey, we’re still alive. </p>

				<h2 class="Georgia normalWeight">On the Future of Gesture</h2>
				<div class="subhead">
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">January 17, 2019</p>
					<p class="BylineText gray heavyWeight">2 min</p>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Working in AR has led me to spend an unhealthy amount of time recently thinking about the new interaction paradigms that may arise alongside this new technology. One of the most compelling ones for me is gesture-based interactions.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Looking at the current major interaction paradigms, we can abstract two major commonalities from them that are crucial for their continued existence: 1) they are agnostic across most population demographics — age, language, and major factors native to the human condition and 2) they require relatively similar levels of effort in the general case and a distinctly lower level of effort in their specific niche cases.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The traditional notions of gesture-based interactions, as exampled by Microsoft Kinect and the cult-classic: Minority Report, are antithetical to both of these commonalities.</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="bodyCopy">Present gestural language is segmented across demographics. Like memes, gestures are created by the collective consciousness of a group and are only used + understood within the group. Those outside the group lack the context and mental models to interpret gestures of other groups. Demographical divides create the most obvious groups - splintering populations across age, race, and culture.</li>
					<li class="bodyCopy">Present gestural language also contains multiple instances of complex movements that are exhausting at scale. i.e. pointing with the finger to select objects or placing a finger to the lips. Generally, all full-arm movements require a level of effort an order of magnitude above wrist-only movements (writing) and finger-only movements (tapping).</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="bodyCopy">My personal belief here is that for a gesture-based interaction paradigm to evolve beyond being just a gimmick, the interaction has to be comprised of a set of primitives in which people can put together (with context) to form the command they want AND it has to be a non-trivial improvement above existing paradigms in non-niche scenarios.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">A few months ago, I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to further develop this thesis by joining the team at <a href="https://pisontechnology.com/" class="hyperlink hyperlinkStart nowrap textblack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pison Technologies</a> as their first interaction designer focused on gestures. Our research surrounds decoding our body's nerve and muscle signals — coupling these signals with an IMU, we can understand a broad range of finger, wrist, and arm movements that were made by a user.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Unlike traditional notions of gestural interfaces that are translated by cameras using computer vision, Pison gestures are translated by a small wearable wristband, allowing for commands to be sent discreetly and effortlessly from spatially-agnostic locations — commands as simple as a flick of a finger.</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I’m excited to see what we create.</p>
