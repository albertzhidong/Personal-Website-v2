					<h4 id="overview" class="black">Overview</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">In the summer of 2018, I joined the AppDynamics Design Technologies team under the direction of Brian Zaik and Eric Wienke. We were a small, but rapidly growing, design team for a suite of products that serves multiple Fortune 500 companies.</p> 
					<p class="bodyCopy black">When I joined the team, we were focusing on building out our internal design system, codenamed Particle. (Release date TBD)</p> 

					<h4 id="role" class="black">My Role</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">I was working independently to define the future of in-app help for the suite of AppDynamics products, working on answering the question of‚Äî</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black italic">What can we do when an user is confused / frustrated within the app?</p>

					<h4 id="rampup" class="black">Ramping Up Onto AppD</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Given that I came in with a rudimentary understanding of AppDynamics‚Äôs suite of enterprise products (APM, EUM, etc), I spent the first week getting up to speed and understanding‚Äî</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our products and how do they work?</br>‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the structure of the company and how does the organization work?</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">After that, I dived deep into understanding how in-app help currently manifests itself within the platform ‚Äî first figuring out the scope of help implementations and then figuring out what problems each component is working to solve. </p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Here, I found it was essential to develop a deeper understanding of the entire suite of products given the breadth of where and when in-app help exists.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Altogether, I discovered 14 different components of in-app help with an average of 2.6 different implementations of each. Further complexifying the project was the existence of AppD University, AppD Forums, and AppD Customer Experience teams which have done pre-existing work to solve the same problem statements through different means.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">To be successful, we can‚Äôt compete with each other, but rather we should augment each other to create an ecosystem of products and pathways that best serve our customer‚Äôs needs.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">As such, my first step was to identify who was leading all of those platforms and check in with the current thoughts surrounding those projects and make sure everyone was aligned. </p>
					<h4 id="initialresearch" class="black">Initial Research</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">The next logical step was to talk to our customers to see what they thought about our current implementations of in-app help.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">To my surprise, there was no internal processes in place for making it easy for the average designer to interface with users so I started off interviewing internal stakeholders, who have directly worked with our users and have synthesized their pain points, while acknowledging their biases.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Concurrently, I spent time looking for users through a variety of mediums with mixed results. This was surprisingly challenging and a far cry from my usual experience getting rapidly feedback for consumer products. Furthermore, it was more difficult as I wanted to find new users to our products, those that are less familiar with our platform and would need more support.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">From these sessions, and their subsequent synthesis, I was able to create lower level problem statements that helped me align myself towards the goal, as well as the other internal stakeholders from AppD University, AppD Forums, and AppD Customer Experience.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Alignment is hard in a larger company ‚Äî a far cry from the startup environment which I was used to.</p>

					<h4 id="designresearch" class="black">Design üîÅ Research</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">After working with our user research team and a fun few rounds of synthesis, we were able to create hash up some basic user personas and some other synthesis docs to work off of. Too much information has always led to paralysis for me so I tried my best to distill insights now to their first principles.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">The goal was to develop a product-agnostic set of components that can be combined to create a framework for in-app help to rest on in its current iteration as well its future potential iterations that were on the product roadmap.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Okay, time for the first round of designs.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">It kinda sucked.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Normal ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">So I put it in front of our internal design team to get feedback ‚Äî they subsequently bodied me.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Great feedback though.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">After another iteration of designs, I decided to place them in front of actual users. (Finding users in enterprise üôÉ)</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">These usability sessions was tricky to lead since the idea of ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, at its essence, is context-specific and wide-ranging. If the users knowing that we were testing our implementations of in-app help, this would reflect in their decision making process and cause their behaviors to shift. Tricky tricky.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">I would love to say that I found the optimal way to approach such situations but the truth of the matter is that, given the small sample size of interviews (5), I was able to make some significant learnings but not formulate a framework to use moving forward.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">These feedback sessions were very helpful, as talking to the real users usually are, and led to the third, and final, iteration of my designs.</p>

					<h4 id="reflections" class="black">Reflections</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">I came into the summer internship wanting a drastically different experience than the ones I had previously. I started in the consumer startup world - and loved it - but was itching to see what else the industry had to offer. So for summer 2018, I jumped to other side of the spectrum ‚Äî post-IPO enterprise.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Was it better?</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy black">Hard to say. It was different for sure, and I learned a lot. At the end of the day, I‚Äôm glad I did it ‚Äî which is what really matters to me in the end. Thank you Brian, Eric, and the AppD team!</p>
