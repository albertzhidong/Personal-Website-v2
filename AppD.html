					<h4 id="overview" class="black">Overview</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">In the summer of 2018, I joined the AppDynamics Design Technologies team under the direction of Brian Zaik and Eric Wienke. We were a small, but rapidly growing, design team for a suite of products that serves multiple Fortune 500 companies.</p> 
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">When I joined the team, we were focusing on building out our internal design system, codenamed Particle.</p> 
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">(Release date TBD)</p> 

					<h4 id="role" class="black">My Role</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">I was working independently to define the future of in-app help for the suite of AppDynamics products, working on answering the question of‚Äî</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack italic">What can we do when an user is confused / frustrated within the app?</p>

					<h4 id="rampup" class="black">Ramping Up Onto AppD</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Given that I came in with a rudimentary understanding of AppDynamics‚Äôs suite of enterprise products (APM, EUM, etc), I spent the first week getting up to speed and understanding‚Äî</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp;What are our products and how do they work?</br>‚Ä¢&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the structure of the company and how does the organization work?</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">After that, I dived deep into understanding how in-app help currently manifests itself within the platform ‚Äî first figuring out the scope of help implementations and then figuring out what problems each component is working to solve. </p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Here, I found it was essential to develop a deeper understanding of the entire suite of products given the breadth of where and when in-app help exists.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Altogether, I discovered 14 different components of in-app help with an average of 2.6 different implementations of each. <span class="italic">Yikes.</span></p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Further complexifying the project was the existence of other teams which have done pre-existing work to solve the same problem statements through different means. While it was awesome to brainstorm with them, that did mean that there were more cooks in the kitchen.</p>
					<div class="smallImg">
						<img src="Media/AppD/Mesh.png" alt="mesh net of cooks">
					</div>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">To be successful, we can‚Äôt compete with each other, but rather we should augment each other‚Äôs work to create an ecosystem of products and features that best serve our customer‚Äôs needs.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">As such, my first step was to identify who was leading all of those platforms and check in with the current thoughts surrounding those projects and make sure everyone was aligned.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Given my lack of experience with complex enterprise products, I wanted to make sure I had a broad swath of product interactions to draw inspiration from before moving forward. As such, I spent two days throughly researching our competitors (Dynatrace, CE) as well as other complex enterprise products (Azure, Confluence, AWS).</p>

					<h4 id="initialresearch" class="black">Initial Research</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">The next logical step was to talk to our customers to see what they thought about our current implementations of in-app help.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">To my surprise, there was no internal processes in place for making it easy for the average designer to interface with users so I started off interviewing internal stakeholders, who have directly worked with our users and have synthesized their pain points, while acknowledging their biases.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Concurrently, I spent time looking for users through a variety of mediums with mixed results. This was surprisingly challenging and a far cry from my usual experience getting rapidly feedback for consumer products. Furthermore, it was more difficult as I wanted to find new users to our products, those that are less familiar with our platform and would need more support.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">From these sessions, and their subsequent synthesis, I was able to create lower level problem statements that helped me align myself towards the goal, as well as the other internal stakeholders.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Alignment is hard in a larger company ‚Äî a far cry from the startup environment which I was used to.</p>

					<h4 id="designresearch" class="black">Design üîÅ Research</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">After working with our user research team and a fun few rounds of synthesis, we were able to create hash up some basic user personas and some other synthesis docs to work off of. Too much information has always led to paralysis for me so I tried my best to distill insights into their first principles.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">The goal was to develop a product-agnostic set of components that can be combined to create a framework for in-app help to rest on in its current iteration as well its future potential iterations that were on the product roadmap.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Okay, time for the first round of designs.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">üí©</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">It kinda sucked.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Normal ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">So I put it in front of our internal design team to get feedback ‚Äî they subsequently wrecked me.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Great feedback though.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">After another iteration of designs, I decided to place them in front of actual users. (Once again, finding users in enterprise üôÉ)</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack italic">Sample v2 screenshots ‚Äî</p>
					<div class="singleImg">
						<img src="Media/AppD/i2_1.png" alt="iteration 2 screenshot">
					</div>
					<div class="singleImg">
						<img src="Media/AppD/i2_2.png" alt="iteration 2 screenshot">
					</div>
					<div class="singleImg">
						<img src="Media/AppD/i2_3.png" alt="iteration 2 screenshot">
					</div>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">For iteration 2, I wanted to test out an interesting hypothesis. While I knew people generally hates dealing the idea of ‚Äúmodes‚Äù given the amount of cognitive it entails + the additional interactions, I thought that it might have a place in bulky enterprise products. </p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">+ the fact that such a small percentage of users interact with in-app help, it didn‚Äôt make sense for it to take up valuable real estate on the screen. </p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">It was just a funny idea. But funny ideas are worth testing.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">These usability sessions was tricky to lead since the idea of ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, at its essence, is context-specific and wide-ranging. If the users knowing that we were testing our implementations of in-app help, this would reflect in their decision making process and cause their behaviors to shift. Tricky tricky.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">I would love to say that I found the optimal way to approach such situations but the truth of the matter is that, given the small sample size of interviews (5), I was able to make some significant learnings but not formulate a framework to use moving forward.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">These feedback sessions were very helpful, as talking to the real users usually are, and led to the third, and final, iteration of my designs.</p>
					<div class="video">
						<iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7_7xQfkZPw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</div>
					<h4 id="highlight" class="black">Select Highlight - Change Commits</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Through the initial round of user interviews, a major pain point that emerged was that there was that it was difficult for AppD users to share company-specific knowledge with their coworkers. This was especially prevalent when teams had to onboard new users onto the platform.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">This was so large of an issue, that many of our Fortune 500 clients created extensive internal databases of help documentation for the AppD product. These became quickly saturated by one line notes that were hard to find. Users hated having to go through those databases. In short, there wasn't context&#60;&#62;information alignment.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Small companies with only 1-2 AppD users per team had it the worst. When that person would leave, the entire scope of product knowledge for that company was lost.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">We needed a way to seamlessly turn that <span class="italic">tribal knowledge into institutional knowledge</span>.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">So I brainstormed ways for users to quickly leave accessible and context-relevant information for their coworkers. That gave birth to the idea of <span class="italic">change commits</span>.</p>
					<div class="smallImg">
						<img src="Media/AppD/ChangeCommit.png" alt="ChangeCommit">
					</div>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">This feature would allow users to leave quick notes on the screen for their coworkers in just 3 clicks anytime. In certain situations, you will be prompted to leave the note right after you make an important change.</p>
					<div class="smallImg">
						<img src="Media/AppD/ChangeCommit2.png" alt="ChangeCommitReaction">
					</div>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack"> This fell right in line with the thesis derived from other teams surrounding the future personalization of the product as an extension of each user.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">What do techies like? Code commits. What might AppD techies like? Change commits.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">While this idea would need to be fleshed out more in order for it to be successful, early user testing is showing favorable results that gives validity to the concept. </p>

					<h4 id="reflections" class="black">Reflections</h4>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">I came into the summer internship wanting a radically different design experience than the ones I had previously. I started in the consumer startup world - and loved it - but was itching to see what else the industry had to offer. So for summer 2018, I jumped to other side of the spectrum ‚Äî post-IPO enterprise.</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">Did I enjoy it?</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">I committed to this internship looking to answer two questions about myself ‚Äî </p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I want to work in big tech after college?</br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I want to work in SF after college?</p>
					<p class="bodyCopy textblack">And over the summer, I found the answers to those two questions. Plus I learned a lot! So I consider this summer a resounding success. Thank you Brian, Eric, and the AppD team!</p>
